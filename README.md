Exercise-02
Read through the passage:
Dear Jane,
I was delighted to read your letter last week. It's always a pleasure to receive the latest news and to hear that you and your family had a great summer.
We spent last week at the beach and had so much fun on the sand and in the water exploring the coast we weren't prepared for the rains that came at the end of the vacation. The best parts of the trip were the opportunities to sightsee and relax.
My kids are back in school to. I find there are fewer things to worry about now that the kids are at school all day. There is plenty of fun things to do in the summer, but by August, I've run out of ideas. I've excepted the fact that we'll have to think up brand-new activities next summer; hoping to round up some creative ideas soon.
Thanks again for your letter!
Sincerely, Karen
